# Models
This directory contains the models used by the runtime. Any models added must be compiled to match the DPU architecture of the loaded overlay. These models can be found from [Xilinx AI Model Zoo (v2.5.0)](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/v2.5/model_zoo). All models in this folder must contain the `.xmodel` extension.
