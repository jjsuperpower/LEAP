# Overlays
This directory is the default path for FPGA bitstreams (overlays).

## Required Files
For every overlay there should be three files with the same name but different extensions:
- `.bit` - The FPGA bitstream
- `.hwh` - The hardware handoff file
- `.xclbin` - The driver information file for VART and XRT
